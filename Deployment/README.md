#### Data Analysis: When $S Strengthen, will DBS share price up or down?
When Sing Dollar strengthen, DBS share price will be expensive for foreign investor, therefore, DBS price should go down, if everything else remain the same.
However, when Sing Dollar strengthen, DBS asset in S$ will appreciate from foreign investor perspective, hence, if DBS has more Sing Dollar Asset than Liability, DBS share price should go up.
Hence, data analytics is important.
