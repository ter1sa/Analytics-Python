# Analytics-Python
This repository contains the following projects where I used Data Analytics to:
1. Predict if the customer will default
2. Predict share price
3. Analyzed the dataset and evaluate the predictive performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, GWTG and Nomogram
4. Develope a method of prediction for the patients who might potentially need intensive care
