# Dependent variable is continuous
#### Assuming you are working in a bank and a customer is requesting for loan. You need to predict if the customer will default the loan. You are to create the predictive model using machine learning model
- Used all the attributes except the index
- Split train test using default rates
- Used dummy variables for Employed
- Split before normalize and oversample the minority
- Normalize annual salary and Bank Balance using zscore
- Data visualization using pandas, seaborn and matplotlib.
- Plot ROC and precision_recall_curve
- Used orange and Keras & tensorflow
- How to improve the results through programming by changing the features selected, data wrangling or parameter setting
- Qualitatively, explain the pros and cons about the models
- How to overcome the weakness of the models (future study)
- The important of the model to the bank
- Used python and flask for deployment
- Deployed via heroku
