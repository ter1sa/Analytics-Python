# Business Case
#### Assuming you are working in a hospital as a data sceintist. You need to predict if a person has alzhemier or not (there are 4 categories). You are to create the predictive model using machine learning model (CNN) and Orange and compare the results between them with explanation.
#### Dataset used (from Kaggle): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images
- Used seaborn heatmap and matplotlib plot.
- Plot loss and accuracy curve (with tail to ensure no underfitting) and not too long (to ensure no overfitting).
- Start with the default parameter CNN layer (32 32 64 64 3,3 filter with activation relu, maxpool 2,2 with stride 2, MLP of 128)
- How to improve the results by change the parameter setting
- Qualitatively, explain the pros and cons of the models
- How to overcome the weakness of the models (future study)
- The importance of the model to the hostpital
- Used orange and compare the accuracy. Explain why the difference.
- Used Resnet (Python) and compare the accuracy. Explain why the difference.
