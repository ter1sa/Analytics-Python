# Business Case
#### Assuming you are working in a bank and a customer is requesting for house loan. You need to estimate the amount of loan you could grant to the customer. Hence you need to estimate the value of the house
- Create model to predict the value of the house using machine learning model
- Used dummy variables on categorical input
- Split train test using default rates
- Normalize floor_area_sqm using zscore
- All machine learning use default setting
- Measurement is rmse
- Random state is 1 (need to use in train test split and model creation)
- Data visualization using pandas, seaborn and matplotlib.
- Used orange and Keras & tensorflow
- Improved the results through programming by changing the features selected, or parameter setting
- Qualitatively, explain the pros and cons about all the models used.
- How to overcome the weakness of all the models (future study)
- The importance of your model to the bank
