# Business Case
#### Assuming you are working in a bank and a customer is requesting for credit card. You need to estimate the amount of credit you could grant to the customer or reject the application Hence you need to predict if the customer will default or not.
- Create model to predict the default using machine learning model (regression, decision tree, random forest, XGboost, SKlearn neural network)
- Data visualization using pandas, seaborn and matplotlib
- Used orange and Keras & tensorflow on neural network.
- Improve the results through programming by changing the features selected, data wrangling or parameter setting
- Plot Confusion Metrics, ROC, precision_recall_curve and explained the results in terms of accuracy and other measurements such as false negative rate
- Qualitatively, explain the pros and cons about all the models used.
- How to overcome the weakness of your all your models (future study)
- The importance of the model to the bank
